# Kareem Aboualnaga

I'm a Frontend Engineer currently working at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on resource management tools. My professional background includes experience in fintech, e-commerce, and cloud services. I focus on building digital products that consider both technical implementation and user experience.

Outside of my primary role, I develop side projects. These serve as a way to explore specific technical ideas, test assumptions about user behavior, and deepen my understanding of how people interact with digital tools. Some of these projects have reached a modest scale.
